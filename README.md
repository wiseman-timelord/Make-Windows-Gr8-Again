# Make-Windows-Gr8-Again
Like the name states, the project is intended to revamp windows 8, which turns out to still be a perfectly good OS, just with version limits. 

### Preview




### Objectives
- Install of, KB2770917, KB2770917, KB2785094, KB2795944, which are critical for things such as "Chat-Gradio-Gguf" to work.  
- Disable relevant components, then Remove Airplane Mode + traces, while not breaking mobile internet support.
- Disable themes. Redirect default starting theme to being Classic (as it always boots with aero, that then unloads for classic). Remove Aero + Traces. 
- Install Python 3.9, using script from other completed project (but remove build tools part, as not working).
- Install of, "Run here as Admin", "Open Command Prompt as Admin", "Add Recycle to Navigation Pane", "Take_Ownership", "enable long folder path over 260 char", "Open Powershell Window here as Admin"
- Addition of my script "Shutdown_NOW" on the desktop.
- Preference of, AMD or nVidia or Both or Ill install my own drivers, to install/not relevantly latest, nVidia or Amd, drivers, that are still compatible with windows 8, therein, they could be hacked versions, that I host personally somewhere, that enable ALL cards the drivers actually supported.    
- Delete default windows media including, pictures and movies, from all user directories, while not deleting other things. Starts by finding and listing all media, conclusion on what was found could be put in a folder and made into a short video.

### Ideas
- Idea: Some kind of shim script, that will automatically check, and if required, capture and resize, contents of terminal output, to being suited to 80 character width display. Thus enabling compatibility with modern python apps, mainly for separators etc.
