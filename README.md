# Make-Windows-Gr8-Again
Like the name states, the project is intended to revamp windows 8, which turns out to still be a perfectly good OS, just with version limits. 

### Objectives
- Disable relevant components, then Remove Airplane Mode + traces.
- Disable themes. Redirect default starting theme to being Classic. Remove Aero + Traces. 
- Install Python 3.9, using script from other completed project (but remove build tools part, as not working).
- TBA
