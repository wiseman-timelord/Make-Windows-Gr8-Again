# Make-Windows-Gr8-Again
Status : Alpha - Its very early development, 99% of the plan is done.

### Description
Like the name states, the project is intended to revamp windows 8, which turns out to still be a perfectly good OS, just with version limits, and "Legacy" versions of essential applications. I do have other project to do though, so, this page also assists people with list of components for their own installations.

### Preview
Most or all, of this stuff should be happening, when you install Windows 8...

### Objectives
- Install of, KB2770917, KB2770917, KB2785094, KB2795944, which are critical for things to work more correctly with somewhat modern apps.  
- Install Python 3.9, using script from other completed project (but remove build tools part, as not working).
- Install of, "Run here as Admin", "Open Command Prompt as Admin", "Add Recycle to Navigation Pane", "Take_Ownership", "Open Powershell Window here as Admin"
- Addition of, `Desktop\Shutdown_Now` and `C\Anti-Anti-H8te`.
- Preference of, AMD or nVidia or Both, to install/not relevantly latest, nVidia 368.81 or Amd (research/find), best drivers, that are still compatible with windows 8 and wide support, therein, they could be post-hacked, ie replace file to enable ALL cards the drivers actually supported.    
- Delete default windows media including, pictures and movies, from all user directories, while not deleting other things. Starts by finding and listing all media, conclusion on what was found could be put in a folder and made into a short video.
- Install K-Lite Codec Pack with options, minimal, regular, full, in sub-menu.
- Disable relevant components, then Remove Airplane Mode + traces, while not breaking mobile internet support.
- Disable themes. Redirect default starting theme to being Classic (as it always boots with aero, that then unloads for classic). Remove Aero + Traces. 
- Enable Firewall and Install of Windows Firewall Control. The firewall already present gets some buffout. (try find latest compatible version)
- Install old version of Driver Booster 8. Its auto-installer seems windows 8 unsupported. It will try to update without the user's concent.
- Install of best version of vulkan_sdk 1.1 able to be found, only available version online from duckduckgo was 1.0.XX. 

### Ideas
- Idea: Some kind of shim script, that will automatically check, and if required, capture and resize, contents of terminal output, to being suited to 80 character width display. Thus enabling compatibility with modern python apps, mainly for separators etc.

### Requirements
Considerations...
- CPU - compatibility was fine with x3900, after a little update with Driver Booster.
- GPU - best ones supported are, TitanX and 1080. Need research the AMD side. Need test hybrid again, but I got it working before. There may be enhancements to do in relevance to hybrid setups.
- Games - Limited to
